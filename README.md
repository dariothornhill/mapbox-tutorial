# Getting Started with Mapbox-GL v2 and Create React App

## To do
- [ ] When user clicks on map, display the marker at the clicked coordinates with a popup. The popup must allow the user to add a title which when saved will save the marker coordinates and title to localstorage
- [x] Display a list of saved markers next to the map (show only title)
- [ ] When user clicks on one of the items in the list, zoom in on the respective marker on the map (increase zoom level to 14)
- [x] For each of the saved markers in the list, allow user to click a 'delete' button to remove it from the list and from localstorage


## Note
1. No additional npm packages are allowed
